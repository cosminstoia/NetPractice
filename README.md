# NetPractice
NetPractice is a project from the 42 School curriculum designed to introduce students to the basics of computer networking, focusing on IP addressing and routing. The goal of the project is to fix or configure network setups in various challenges by solving network issues using routing, subnetting, and other IP-related techniques.
## Overview
The NetPractice project consists of a series of networking exercises that simulate real-world scenarios where network configurations need to be corrected or optimized. Through this project, students learn the fundamentals of networking, including:
- IP addressing (IPv4)
- Subnetting
- Routing tables
- Network troubleshooting
## Technologies
This project does not rely on any programming language or framework but instead focuses on understanding network configurations. The tools used include:
- **Network Simulations**: Custom exercises provided by 42.
- **Subnet Calculators** (optional): To assist with subnetting and address allocation.
## Skills Developed
Throughout the project, I have worked on and improved the following skills:
- **Subnetting**: Understanding and applying subnet masks, CIDR notation, and efficient IP address management.
- **Routing**: Configuring routing tables and understanding how routers forward packets between networks.
- **IP Addressing**: Assigning correct IP addresses and gateways to devices in a network.
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Identifying and fixing broken network configurations.
